Chenab, Raaga Vangala, Alex Albors Juez, Alexander W. Hsu 

## Goals of GP Package Implementation (TODOS)
Make a GP class with standard methods and approximations:
1. Implement fit, predict, re_fit. 
2. Implement random fourier features.
3. Implement RPCholesky. 
4. Implement families of kernels based on Gaussian mixtures (Wilson's paper). 
5. Kernel methods for PDEs.
